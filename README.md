## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move the falling Tetromino (block) left, right, or down.
- Press the spacebar to rotate the Tetromino.
- The goal is to complete horizontal lines by filling them with blocks. When a line is completed, it will be cleared, and the player will earn points.
- If the Tetromino reaches the top of the game board, the game is over.
- The game speed will gradually increase as the player earns more points.

## Features
